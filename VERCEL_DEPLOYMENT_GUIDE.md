# ðŸš€ Deploying PaintQuoteApp.com to Vercel

This guide will walk you through deploying your painting quote app to Vercel and connecting your custom domain.

## Prerequisites
- GitHub account (or GitLab/Bitbucket)
- paintquoteapp.com domain purchased from GoDaddy
- Your app code (already built and tested)

## Step 1: Push Code to GitHub

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name it: `paintquoteapp`
   - Make it private if you prefer
   - Don't initialize with README (you already have one)

2. Push your code:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/paintquoteapp.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

1. **Sign up/Login to Vercel**
   - Go to https://vercel.com
   - Sign up with your GitHub account (easiest option)

2. **Import Project**
   - Click "Add New..." â†’ "Project"
   - Import your `paintquoteapp` repository
   - Vercel will detect it's a Next.js project automatically

3. **Configure Build Settings**
   - **Framework Preset**: Next.js (auto-detected)
   - **Root Directory**: `.` (leave as is)
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build` (default)
   - **Output Directory**: Leave empty (Next.js handles this)
   - **Install Command**: `npm install` (default)

4. **Environment Variables**
   - Click "Environment Variables"
   - Add your Google Gemini API key:
     - Name: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_API_KEY`
     - Value: Your API key from Google AI Studio
   - Add any other environment variables from your `.env.local` file

5. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for the build to complete
   - You'll get a URL like: `paintquoteapp-xxxxx.vercel.app`

## Step 3: Add Custom Domain

1. **In Vercel Dashboard**
   - Go to your project settings
   - Click "Domains" in the left sidebar
   - Type `paintquoteapp.com` and click "Add"
   - Also add `www.paintquoteapp.com`

2. **Vercel will show you DNS records to add**
   You'll see something like:
   ```
   A Record: @ â†’ 76.76.21.21
   CNAME: www â†’ cname.vercel-dns.com
   ```

## Step 4: Configure GoDaddy DNS

1. **Login to GoDaddy**
   - Go to https://godaddy.com
   - My Products â†’ DNS for paintquoteapp.com

2. **Update DNS Records**
   - Delete any existing A records for @ (if any)
   - Add the records Vercel provided:
   
   **For the root domain (paintquoteapp.com):**
   - Type: A
   - Name: @
   - Value: 76.76.21.21 (use the IP Vercel gives you)
   - TTL: 600

   **For www subdomain:**
   - Type: CNAME
   - Name: www
   - Value: cname.vercel-dns.com (use what Vercel gives you)
   - TTL: 600

3. **Save Changes**
   - Click "Save" in GoDaddy
   - DNS propagation can take 5-48 hours (usually 5-30 minutes)

## Step 5: Verify Domain in Vercel

1. Go back to Vercel â†’ Domains
2. You'll see "Verifying" next to your domain
3. Once DNS propagates, it will show "Valid Configuration" âœ…
4. Vercel automatically provisions SSL certificates

## Step 6: Final Configuration

1. **Set Production Domain**
   - In Vercel â†’ Settings â†’ Domains
   - Set `paintquoteapp.com` as the primary domain
   - `www.paintquoteapp.com` will redirect to the main domain

2. **Environment Variables for Production**
   - Double-check all environment variables are set
   - Especially the Google API key

## Testing Your Live Site

Once DNS propagates, test:
- https://paintquoteapp.com
- https://www.paintquoteapp.com
- Try creating a quote
- Test the admin panel
- Check mobile responsiveness

## Troubleshooting

**Site not loading?**
- DNS can take up to 48 hours (but usually much faster)
- Use https://dnschecker.org to check propagation
- Make sure you added both A and CNAME records

**Build failing?**
- Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Make sure all dependencies are in package.json
- Environment variables might be missing

**Database issues?**
- SQLite database will be created fresh on Vercel
- You'll need to use the seed data or manually add companies

## Ongoing Deployment

After initial setup, any push to your GitHub main branch will:
1. Trigger automatic deployment on Vercel
2. Build and deploy in ~2 minutes
3. Zero downtime deployment

## Costs

- **Vercel Free Tier**: Includes
  - 100GB bandwidth/month
  - Unlimited deployments
  - SSL certificates
  - Global CDN
  
- **When to upgrade**: Only if you exceed 100GB bandwidth (thousands of users)
