## 🤝 2. COMMITMENT & CONSISTENCY - Small Yes → Big Yes

### Current Issues:
- Asking for full signup too early
- No micro-commitments building to paid conversion
- Missing progressive disclosure

### Improvements:

1. **Micro-Commitment 1**: "See how fast you can create a quote" (1-click demo)
2. **Micro-Commitment 2**: "Save your first quote template" (requires email only)
3. **Micro-Commitment 3**: "Complete 2-minute setup" (builds investment)
4. **Macro-Commitment**: "Upgrade to unlimited" (after they're invested)

#### Dashboard Progress Bar:
```
NEW: "🏆 Your ProPaint Journey - 3/7 Steps Complete
      ✓ Created account

```

## 👥 3. SOCIAL PROOF - Show Others Succeeding

### Current Issues:
- Generic "5,000+ contractors" without faces/stories
- No real-time activity feed
- Missing specific success metrics

### Improvements:

#### Homepage - Live Activity Feed:
```

```

#### Pricing Page - Specific Testimonials:
```

with my FIRST quote. Now doing $65K/month, up from $20K."
- Mike Rodriguez, Rodriguez Painting (Austin, TX)
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Verified Customer Since 2023
```

#### Dashboard - Peer Comparison:
```
NEW: "📊 How You Compare to Other [City] Contractors:
• Your quotes/month: 12 (Average: 8)
• Your win rate: 35% (Average: 28%)
• Your avg quote: $3,200 (Average: $2,800)
You're in the top 30%! 🎉"
```

## 🏆 4. AUTHORITY - Demonstrate Expertise

### Current Issues:
- Not leveraging industry credentials
- Missing expert endorsements
- No certifications displayed

### Improvements:

#### Homepage Trust Section:
```
NEW: "Trusted by Industry Leaders

```

#### Quote Creation Page:
```

ProPaint automatically calculates the right coverage.'"
```

## 💕 5. LIKING - Be Relatable and Helpful

### Current Issues:
- Too corporate, not enough personality
- No founder story or personal connection
- Missing humor and relatability

### Improvements:

#### About Section:
```
NEW: "Hey, I'm Tom - Founder of ProPaint Quote 👋

I was a painting contractor for 15 years. Lost too many 
jobs because I was slow with quotes. My wife (also in 
the business) said 'There has to be a better way!'

So we built ProPaint Quote. Not some Silicon Valley startup - 
just contractors helping contractors win more jobs.

P.S. Yes, I still paint on weekends. Old habits! 🎨"
```

#### Error Messages with Personality:
```
OLD: "Error: Invalid input"
NEW: "Oops! 🎨 Looks like we got paint on the keyboard. 
     Let's try that again - need a number here!"
```

## ⏰ 6. SCARCITY - Create Appropriate Urgency

### Current Issues:
- No time limits or exclusive offers
- Unlimited free trial reduces urgency
- Missing "fear of missing out" elements
