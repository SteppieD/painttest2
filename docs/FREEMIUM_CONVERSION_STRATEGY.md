# Freemium to Paid Conversion Optimization Strategy

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Conversion Principles

### 1. **Time to First Value (TFV) < 5 Minutes**
Users must experience the "aha moment" within their first session. For ProPaint Quote, this means creating their first professional quote successfully.

### 2. **Progressive Value Disclosure**
Don't show all features at once. Guide users through a journey where each step reveals more value.

### 3. **Usage-Based Upgrade Prompts**
Trigger upgrade prompts based on behavior, not just time. Examples:
- After 3rd quote created
- When approaching quota limit
- After customer accepts a quote
- When trying premium features
