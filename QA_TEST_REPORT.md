   - Hover over "Solutions" and "Resources" doesn't show dropdown menus
   - JavaScript hover events not triggering properly
   - No dropdown content visible when hovering

4. **MEDIUM - Blue gradient backgrounds**:

## Summary of Critical Issues

- Navigation dropdowns don't appear on hover

- Too many gradients and soft colors

### 4. Functionality Issues
