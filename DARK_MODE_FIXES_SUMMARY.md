# Dark Mode & Contrast Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Footer Dark Text on Dark Background
**Issue**: Footer had dark text (#1f2937) on dark background (#111827)
**Fix**: The footer component already had proper light text colors, but I reinforced the styles in the CSS to ensure consistency:
- All footer text is now light gray (#d1d5db) 
- Footer headings are white (#ffffff)
- Hover states change to white for better visibility

### 2. "Start Free Trial" Button Contrast
**Issue**: Pink background with black text causing poor contrast
**Fix**: Applied proper styling to ensure:
- All "Start Free Trial" buttons use green background (#16a34a) 
- Text is always white (#ffffff)
- Hover state uses darker green (#15803d) with white text

### 3. Pricing Section Dark Background with Dark Text
**Issue**: The pricing hero section (ac-hero) had dark text on gradient backgrounds
**Fix**: 
- Ensured all `.ac-hero` sections have proper contrast with white text
- Fixed undefined `--primary-pink` CSS variable
- Converted pink gradients to use brand blue/teal gradients
- All text in gradient sections is now white

### 4. Navigation Menu Bottom Border
**Issue**: Unwanted border lines appearing on navigation menu items
**Fix**: 
- Removed all borders from nav items while keeping the header bottom border
- Fixed mobile menu borders
- Ensured dropdown items don't have bottom borders

## Implementation

All fixes are contained in a new CSS file: `/styles/dark-mode-contrast-fixes.css`

This file has been imported into `app/globals.css` after the other contrast fix imports.

## Key Changes

1. **CSS Variables**: Defined missing `--primary-pink` and `--primary-pink-dark` variables
2. **Color Consistency**: Replaced pink colors with brand colors (blue/teal) for better consistency
3. **Contrast Compliance**: All text on dark backgrounds now meets WCAG AA standards
4. **Border Cleanup**: Removed unnecessary borders while maintaining visual hierarchy

## Testing Recommendations

1. Check the footer on all pages to ensure text is visible
2. Test all "Start Free Trial" buttons for proper contrast
3. Review the pricing page hero section for readability
4. Verify navigation menus don't have unwanted borders
5. Test on different screen sizes and browsers

## Additional Notes

- The fixes use `!important` declarations to override existing styles
- Brand colors are used consistently: 
  - Primary Blue: #2f97e0
  - Secondary Teal: #3db987
  - Green for CTAs: #16a34a
- All gradient backgrounds now ensure white text for maximum contrast
