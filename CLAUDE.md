## Architecture & Structure
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router, React 18, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom UI components in `/components/ui/`
- **Database**: SQLite with better-sqlite3, full admin tables
- **AI Integration**: Google Generative AI for quote assistance
- **State Management**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Admin System**: JWT-based authentication with session management

## Code Standards
- Use TypeScript strictly - no `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- Follow existing component patterns in `/components/`
- Use the custom UI components from `/components/ui/` instead of creating new ones
- Maintain consistent file naming: kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components
- Keep API routes in `/app/api/` following Next.js 14 conventions

## Database Guidelines
- Database file: `painting_quotes_app.db`
- Schema initialization handled automatically via `/lib/database/init.ts`
- Use prepared statements for all queries
- Handle database errors gracefully with proper error messages

## Enhanced Quote Creation Logic
- **Customer Name Parsing** (`/lib/improved-conversation-parser.ts`) - Fixed "Name and his/her/their address" patterns
- **Smart Measurement Collection** (`/app/create-quote/page.tsx`) - Surface-specific measurement logic
- **Favorite Paint Selection** (`/components/ui/favorite-paint-selector.tsx`) - One-click selection from contractor's favorites
- **Setup Wizard** (`/app/setup/page.tsx`) - 4-step onboarding: Welcome → Project Types → Paint Favorites → Markup
- **Company Preferences** (`/api/companies/preferences`) - Stores setup completion status and default markup
- **Paint Selection System** (`/api/paint-products/brands`, `/components/ui/paint-*-selector.tsx`) - Interactive brand/product selection
- **Conversation Stages** - `paint_brand_selection`, `paint_product_selection`, `paint_cost_validation`, `quote_editing`, `ready_for_paint_selection`

## Component Best Practices
- Use server components by default, client components only when needed
- Implement proper loading states and error boundaries
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use the existing toast system for user notifications

## Testing & Quality
- Run `npm run lint` before committing
- Test responsive design on mobile and desktop
- Verify database operations don't block the UI
- Ensure all forms have proper validation

## Common Workflows
1. **Adding new features**: Check existing patterns in similar components first
2. **Database changes**: Update schema in `/lib/database/schema.sql`
3. **UI updates**: Use existing components from `/components/ui/`
4. **API endpoints**: Follow RESTful conventions in `/app/api/`

## Security Considerations
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Validate API requests with Zod schemas
- Keep sensitive configuration in environment variables

## Previous Bug Fixes (Jun 14, 2025)
### **Dashboard Analytics Issue Resolution**
**Problem**: All analytics dashboard pages showing zeros instead of actual data
- `/insights` - Business metrics empty
- `/dashboard/revenue` - Revenue analysis empty 
- `/dashboard/this-month` - Monthly performance empty
- `/dashboard/total-quotes` - Quote analytics empty

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. **Database Schema Mismatch**: Insights API expected `project_id` column and projects table JOIN, but quotes table stores customer data directly
2. **Column Name Inconsistency**: Analytics expected `final_price` but database uses `total_revenue` 
3. **API Response Structure**: Analytics pages expected direct array but API returns `{quotes: [...]}` wrapper
4. **Null Value Handling**: Missing null safety in calculations causing NaN results

**Solutions Applied**:
1. **Updated Insights API** (`/app/api/insights/route.ts`):
   - Removed projects table JOIN dependency
   - Changed query to use quotes table directly: `q.customer_name as client_name, q.address as property_address`
   - Updated userFilter to use `company_id` instead of non-existent `user_id`
   - Fixed all revenue calculations to use `total_revenue` instead of `final_price`

2. **Fixed All Dashboard Pages**:
   - **Revenue Page** (`/app/dashboard/revenue/page.tsx`): Added wrapper response handling and null safety
   - **This Month Page** (`/app/dashboard/this-month/page.tsx`): Fixed data structure and calculations
   - **Total Quotes Page** (`/app/dashboard/total-quotes/page.tsx`): Updated response parsing
   - Added `|| 0` fallbacks for all quote amount calculations to prevent NaN errors

3. **Database Column Mapping**:
   - All analytics now correctly use `quote_amount` from API response
   - Proper handling of both `{quotes: [...]}` wrapper and direct array responses

**Current Analytics Data**:
- **Total Revenue**: $73,880.50 across 10 quotes
- **Average Quote**: $7,388.05 per quote  
- **Acceptance Rate**: 10% (1 accepted, 9 pending)
- **Monthly Trends**: All displaying correctly with proper data visualization
