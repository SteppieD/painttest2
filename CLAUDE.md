## Architecture & Structure
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router, React 18, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom UI components in `/components/ui/`
- **Database**: SQLite with better-sqlite3, full admin tables
- **AI Integration**: Google Generative AI for quote assistance
- **State Management**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Admin System**: JWT-based authentication with session management

## Code Standards
- Use TypeScript strictly - no `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- Follow existing component patterns in `/components/`
- Use the custom UI components from `/components/ui/` instead of creating new ones
- Maintain consistent file naming: kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components
- Keep API routes in `/app/api/` following Next.js 14 conventions

## Database Guidelines
- Database file: `painting_quotes_app.db`
- Schema initialization handled automatically via `/lib/database/init.ts`
- Use prepared statements for all queries
- Handle database errors gracefully with proper error messages

## Enhanced Quote Creation Logic
- **Customer Name Parsing** (`/lib/improved-conversation-parser.ts`) - Fixed "Name and his/her/their address" patterns
- **Smart Measurement Collection** (`/app/create-quote/page.tsx`) - Surface-specific measurement logic
- **Paint Selection System** (`/api/paint-products/brands`, `/components/ui/paint-*-selector.tsx`) - Interactive brand/product selection
- **Conversation Stages** - `paint_brand_selection`, `paint_product_selection`, `paint_cost_validation`, `quote_editing`, `ready_for_paint_selection`

## Component Best Practices
- Use server components by default, client components only when needed
- Implement proper loading states and error boundaries
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use the existing toast system for user notifications

## Testing & Quality
- Run `npm run lint` before committing
- Test responsive design on mobile and desktop
- Verify database operations don't block the UI
- Ensure all forms have proper validation

## Common Workflows
1. **Adding new features**: Check existing patterns in similar components first
2. **Database changes**: Update schema in `/lib/database/schema.sql`
3. **UI updates**: Use existing components from `/components/ui/`
4. **API endpoints**: Follow RESTful conventions in `/app/api/`

## Security Considerations
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Validate API requests with Zod schemas
- Keep sensitive configuration in environment variables

## Recent Bug Fixes (Jun 14, 2025)
### **Dashboard Analytics Issue Resolution**
**Problem**: All analytics dashboard pages showing zeros instead of actual data
- `/insights` - Business metrics empty
- `/dashboard/revenue` - Revenue analysis empty 
- `/dashboard/this-month` - Monthly performance empty
- `/dashboard/total-quotes` - Quote analytics empty

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. **Database Schema Mismatch**: Insights API expected `project_id` column and projects table JOIN, but quotes table stores customer data directly
2. **Column Name Inconsistency**: Analytics expected `final_price` but database uses `total_revenue` 
3. **API Response Structure**: Analytics pages expected direct array but API returns `{quotes: [...]}` wrapper
4. **Null Value Handling**: Missing null safety in calculations causing NaN results

**Solutions Applied**:
1. **Updated Insights API** (`/app/api/insights/route.ts`):
   - Removed projects table JOIN dependency
   - Changed query to use quotes table directly: `q.customer_name as client_name, q.address as property_address`
   - Updated userFilter to use `company_id` instead of non-existent `user_id`
   - Fixed all revenue calculations to use `total_revenue` instead of `final_price`

2. **Fixed All Dashboard Pages**:
   - **Revenue Page** (`/app/dashboard/revenue/page.tsx`): Added wrapper response handling and null safety
   - **This Month Page** (`/app/dashboard/this-month/page.tsx`): Fixed data structure and calculations
   - **Total Quotes Page** (`/app/dashboard/total-quotes/page.tsx`): Updated response parsing
   - Added `|| 0` fallbacks for all quote amount calculations to prevent NaN errors

3. **Database Column Mapping**:
   - All analytics now correctly use `quote_amount` from API response
   - Proper handling of both `{quotes: [...]}` wrapper and direct array responses

**Current Analytics Data**:
- **Total Revenue**: $73,880.50 across 10 quotes
- **Average Quote**: $7,388.05 per quote  
- **Acceptance Rate**: 10% (1 accepted, 9 pending)
- **Monthly Trends**: All displaying correctly with proper data visualization

## Key File Updates (Jun 14, 2025)
- `app/create-quote/page.tsx` - Smart measurement logic and paint selection stages
- `lib/improved-conversation-parser.ts` - Fixed customer name parsing with possessive pronouns
- `app/api/paint-products/brands/route.ts` - Brand/category grouping API
- `components/ui/paint-brand-selector.tsx` - Visual brand selection component
- `components/ui/paint-product-selector.tsx` - Product selection with quality indicators
- `app/api/insights/route.ts` - Fixed database schema mismatch and column references
- `app/dashboard/revenue/page.tsx` - Added response wrapper handling and null safety
- `app/dashboard/this-month/page.tsx` - Fixed data parsing and calculations  
- `app/dashboard/total-quotes/page.tsx` - Updated response structure handling

## Latest Features Added (Jun 15, 2025)

### **🎨 Measurement-Driven Paint Selection Workflow**
**Revolutionary UX Enhancement**: After measurements are collected for any surface category, users immediately select paint brand and product for that specific category before moving to the next.

**New User Flow**:
```
Surface Selection → 
  Category 1: Measurements → Brand Selection → Product Selection → 
  Category 2: Measurements → Brand Selection → Product Selection → 
  ... → 
  Markup Selection → Final Quote
```

**Key Components**:
- **Smart Category Queue**: `measurementQueue` tracks categories needing measurement/paint selection
- **Real-time Progress**: `categoryCompletionStatus` shows measured/paintSelected status per category
- **Visual Selection**: `PaintBrandSelector` and `PaintProductSelector` components render directly in conversation
- **Context-Aware**: Paint selection happens immediately after measurements while context is fresh

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Immediate Context** - Paint selection right after measurements for each surface
- ✅ **Reduced Cognitive Load** - One category at a time instead of remembering all
- ✅ **Better UX** - Visual component selection with quality indicators
- ✅ **Clear Progress** - Users see completion status per category

### **💭 AI Thinking Animation**
**Enhanced Conversational Experience**: Added sophisticated "thinking" bubble that appears before AI responses.

**Features**:
- **Smart Duration**: 500ms for short responses, 1000ms for longer responses (>200 chars)
- **Visual Animation**: Three bouncing dots with staggered timing (0ms, 150ms, 300ms delays)
- **Smooth Transitions**: Thinking → Brief loading → Response
- **Professional Feel**: More human-like interaction patterns

### **🏠 Homepage Mobile Navigation**
**Responsive Design Fix**: Added hamburger menu for tablet and mobile screen sizes.

**Implementation**:
- **Mobile Menu State**: `isMobileMenuOpen` with toggle functionality
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: Desktop (768px+) traditional nav, Mobile (<768px) hamburger menu
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and focus states
- **Complete Navigation**: All links available in mobile dropdown

### **📊 Enhanced Conversation Messaging**
**Clearer User Guidance**: Updated all measurement requests to explain WHY measurements are needed.

**Examples**:
- **Before**: "Now I need the dimensions"
- **After**: "I need the room dimensions so I can calculate the ceiling area for accurate paint coverage"

**Improvements**:
- Wall dimensions explain calculation purpose
- Door/window counts explain coverage calculations  
- Room measurements explain ceiling area needs
- Prevents user confusion about duplicate information
