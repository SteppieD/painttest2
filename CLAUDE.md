2. Run `npm run build` to verify it builds
3. Deploy manually: `vercel --prod`

## Development Commands

### Core Development
- `npm run dev` - Start development server on localhost:3001
- `npm run build` - Build for production (required before deployment)
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint and identify code quality issues
- `npm start` - Start production server

### Database Operations
- Database auto-initializes SQLite on first run (`painting_quotes_app.db`)
- Test endpoints: `/api/test-connection`, `/api/test-db`, `/api/test-supabase`
- Reset database: Delete `.db` files to reinitialize with fresh schema

### Testing Access Points
- **Demo Access Codes**: `DEMO2024`, `PAINTER001`, `CONTRACTOR123`
- **Admin Portal**: Login at `/admin` with admin@paintingapp.com / admin123
- **Modern Interface**: Access via `/dashboard-modern` or access code modern option

## DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW - VERCEL AUTO-DEPLOY
**CRITICAL**: This project automatically deploys to Vercel when git is updated. 
- **MANDATORY WORKFLOW**: Make changes → Build locally → Commit to git → Push to git → Vercel auto-deploys → Test on live site
- **NEVER TEST WITHOUT GIT PUSH**: Changes only appear on Vercel after `git push` - always push before testing
- **Required Commands After Every Change**:
  ```bash
  npm run build  # Verify no errors
  git add -A && git commit -m "Description of changes"
  git push       # REQUIRED - Vercel deploys from git
  ```
- **Live URL**: Auto-deployed via Vercel when git commits are pushed
- **Testing**: All testing happens on the live Vercel deployment, not local dev server
- **DO NOT run development servers** - changes are tested live on Vercel

## Core Architecture Patterns

### Dual Interface Strategy (Revolutionary Design)
**Problem Solved**: Different user needs for quote creation speed vs comprehensiveness

**Architecture**:
- **Traditional Interface** (`/dashboard`, `/create-quote`): Conversational AI-driven workflow (5-10 min quotes)
- **Modern Interface** (`/dashboard-modern`, `/components/ui/express-quote-creator.tsx`): Template-based express quotes (30 seconds)

**Key Implementation**: Both interfaces feed into the same calculation engine (`/lib/professional-quote-calculator.ts`) but with different data collection strategies.

### Hybrid Database Strategy (Multi-Environment Resilience)
**Architecture Pattern**: Environment-aware database selection with graceful fallbacks

**Implementation**:
- **Development**: SQLite with better-sqlite3 (`painting_quotes_app.db`)
- **Production**: Supabase PostgreSQL (`/lib/database/supabase-adapter.ts`)
- **Fallback**: In-memory mock data (`/lib/database-simple.ts`)

**Key Files**:
- `/lib/database/init.ts` - SQLite initialization with schema execution
- `/lib/database/schema.sql` - 242-line schema supporting 30+ tables
- Auto-migration system with cross-database JSON compatibility

### Progressive Quote Calculation Engine (Multi-Strategy Intelligence)
**Problem Solved**: Accurate pricing with varying levels of input data

**Calculation Strategies** (in order of accuracy):
1. **Dimensional**: Actual room measurements (`/lib/progressive-calculator.ts`)
2. **Surface-Based**: Room count + surface selection
3. **Project Type**: Basic classification estimates
4. **Industry Average**: Fallback pricing

**Smart Learning Integration** (`/lib/smart-defaults.ts`):
- Analyzes contractor quote history for pattern recognition
- Suggests room dimensions, paint preferences, pricing based on frequency
- Provides confidence levels (high/medium/low) for suggestions

### State Management Optimization (Performance Innovation)
**Achievement**: 50% reduction in component re-renders

**Implementation** (`/lib/quote-state-manager.ts`):
- Consolidated 25+ useState hooks into single useReducer pattern
- Type-safe action system with comprehensive state modeling
- Real-time progressive estimation integration
- Optimistic updates for perceived performance

### Multi-Tenant Access System (Company Isolation)
**Architecture**: Dynamic company creation with session management

**Flow**:
1. Access code entry creates/retrieves company profile
2. Setup wizard customizes paint products and pricing
3. Company-scoped data isolation throughout application
4. Session persistence with 24-hour expiration

**Key Files**:
- `/app/access-code/page.tsx` - Company resolution and session creation
- `/app/setup/page.tsx` - 4-step progressive onboarding
- `/api/companies/` - Company preference management

## Critical Development Workflows

### Working with the Quote Calculation System
**Understanding the Flow**: Quote creation spans multiple files with different calculation strategies

**Development Pattern**:
1. **Data Collection**: Either traditional chat (`/app/create-quote/page.tsx`) or modern templates (`/components/ui/express-quote-creator.tsx`)
2. **Progressive Calculation**: Real-time estimates via `/lib/progressive-calculator.ts` using available data
3. **Smart Suggestions**: AI learning system (`/lib/smart-defaults.ts`) provides intelligent defaults
4. **Final Calculation**: Unified engine (`/lib/professional-quote-calculator.ts`) processes all quote types
5. **State Management**: Optimized with useReducer pattern (`/lib/quote-state-manager.ts`)

**Testing Quote Calculations**:
- Test both interfaces with identical project data to verify calculation consistency
- Use different data completeness levels to test progressive estimation strategies
- Verify smart suggestions improve over time with more quote history

### Database Development Workflow
**Multi-Environment Testing Pattern**:

**SQLite Development**:
1. Delete `.db` files to reset to fresh schema
2. Run `npm run dev` to auto-initialize from `/lib/database/schema.sql`
3. Use browser endpoints `/api/test-db` for connectivity verification
4. Test with access codes to verify multi-tenant data isolation

**Cross-Database Compatibility**:
- JSON fields stored as TEXT in SQLite, native JSON in PostgreSQL
- Foreign key constraints work differently across databases
- Test migration scenarios with existing data

### Modern UX Development Pattern
**Design System Implementation**:
- Use CSS custom properties from `/styles/design-system.css`
- Follow 44pt minimum touch targets for mobile optimization
- Implement progressive disclosure patterns for complex workflows

## Deployment & Maintenance Guide

   - Or use `vercel` for preview deployment
   - Note: Automatic deployments from GitHub are DISABLED - all deployments must be manual
2. **Railway**: One-click deploy from GitHub
3. **Docker**: `docker-compose up -d` for containerized deployment
4. **Local Testing**: `npm run dev` for development environment

### **⚠️ CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT NOTE:**
- **GitHub auto-deployment is PERMANENTLY DISABLED** - pushing to main branch does NOT trigger automatic Vercel deployments
- **ALL Vercel deployments MUST be done MANUALLY** using the CLI
- **This is intentional** - provides better control over production deployments
- **NEVER assume automatic deployment** - always run `vercel --prod` manually

### **Standard Deployment Practice:**
1. **Commit and Push to GitHub**: 
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your changes"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Manual Vercel Deployment (REQUIRED)**:
   ```bash
   # For production (most common)
   vercel --prod
   
   # For preview/staging
   vercel
   ```

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Check the URL provided by Vercel CLI
   - Test the deployed features
   - Monitor for any errors

**REMINDER**: Every deployment to production requires running `vercel --prod` manually. There is NO automatic deployment.

### **Environment Setup:**
```bash
# Required environment variables
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your_api_key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key  # For Claude Sonnet 4
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=your_domain

# Optional for advanced features

- ✅ Fixed pricing table to detect logged-in users via sessionStorage

**Files Created/Modified:**

- `/app/trial-success/page.tsx` - Trial signup success
- `/app/subscription/manage/page.tsx` - Subscription management
- `/components/stripe/modern-pricing-table.tsx` - Session-aware checkout

#### 2. **Stripe Payment Integration**

```env
# Test Keys Configured

STRIPE_BUSINESS_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID=price_1RgwQRGbblInKQeXxTxAs1Gl
STRIPE_BUSINESS_YEARLY_PRICE_ID=price_1RgwSSGbblInKQeXVcNtdFKn
```

**Test Endpoints Created:**

- ✅ Email automation engine (`/lib/email-automation.ts`)
- ✅ Professional HTML email templates
- ✅ Event tracking system for user actions
- ✅ Scheduled campaign delivery

**Email Campaigns Implemented:**
```typescript
// Trial Onboarding (14-day sequence)
- Day 0: Welcome email with quick start guide
- Day 1: "Did you create your first quote?" check-in
- Day 3: Feature discovery - time savings
- Day 7: Success story from similar contractor
- Day 10: Progress report with stats
- Day 12: Special upgrade offer (20% off)
- Day 14: Trial ending warning

// Activity-Based Triggers
- First quote created → Tips for winning the job
- Quote accepted → Congratulations & next steps
- Inactive 3 days → Re-engagement campaign
- Approaching limit → Upgrade prompt
```

**Integration Points:**
- Trial signup automatically triggers welcome sequence
- Quote creation tracked for automation
- User events stored for analytics

#### 4. **Email Provider Configuration**
**Current Status:**
- ❌ No email provider configured (using mock/console)
- ✅ Everything ready for instant activation

**To Enable Email (5 minutes):**
```env
# Option A: Resend (Recommended)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=hello@propaintquote.com

# Option B: SendGrid
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your_api_key_here
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=hello@propaintquote.com
```

**Quick Setup Guide:**
1. Sign up at https://resend.com (free tier: 100 emails/day)
2. Get API key from dashboard
3. Add to `.env.local`
4. Test with `curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/test-email`

#### 5. **MCP Integration Research**
**Findings:**
- No native Mailchimp/email marketing MCPs available
- Zapier MCP exists but not currently installed
- Best approach: Direct API integration with email providers

**Recommended Stack:**
- Transactional: Resend (already integrated)
- Marketing: Loops.so or Customer.io (via API)

## 🆕 Latest Updates (July 5, 2025) - Chat Memory & Navigation Fixes

### 🤖 Chat Memory Improvements - COMPLETED
**Problem:** Chatbot was forgetting customer information and asking for already-provided details

**Root Causes Found & Fixed:**
1. **Conversation history wasn't being passed to AI** - Fixed in `/lib/unified-quote-assistant.ts`
2. **Customer info being overwritten** - Now preserves existing data
3. **Address numbers parsed as measurements** - Added logic to detect customer info messages
4. **Missing paint cost defaults** - Now uses `DEFAULT_PAINT_PRODUCTS` when not provided

**Key Files Modified:**
- `/lib/unified-quote-assistant.ts` - Main chat processing logic
  - Added conversation history to AI requests (lines 899-902)
  - Fixed customer info preservation (lines 77-94)
  - Removed paint cost requirement (line 297)
  - Added default paint products usage (lines 342-360)
- `/lib/improved-conversation-parser.ts` - Natural language parsing
  - Added "quote for X at Y" pattern (lines 63-74)
  - Fixed room dimension parsing (lines 240-264)
  - Added room count tracking

**Test Results:**
```javascript
// Before: Bot asks for name again
USER: A indoor painting quote for Lina at 2828 Hillside Drive
BOT: Got it! Just need more info...
USER: only walls, 2 rooms, ceiling is 9 feet high
BOT: What's the customer name? // ❌ Already provided!

// After: Bot remembers context
USER: A indoor painting quote for Lina at 2828 Hillside Drive
BOT: Got it! Just need: linear feet of walls, ceiling height.
USER: only walls, 2 rooms, ceiling is 9 feet high
BOT: Got it! Just need: linear feet of walls.
USER: 15 feet by 12 feet for each room
BOT: ✅ Quote for Lina - Total: $3,109 // ✅ Remembers name!
```

### 🎨 Navigation Menu Redesign - COMPLETED

   - Mobile menu updated to match

### 🧪 Testing Tools Created

   - Add chat history persistence across sessions

### 🔧 Quick Reference Commands
```bash
# Local Development

# Deployment

```

- Default paint: Sherwin Williams ProClassic at $65/gallon
- Default labor rate: $1.50/sqft for walls
- Conversation history limited to last 6 messages for context
