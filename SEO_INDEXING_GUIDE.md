# SEO Indexing Guide - Paint Quote App

## 📊 Current Status (January 8, 2025)
- **42 pages** discovered but not indexed
- Google knows about the pages but hasn't crawled them yet
- This is normal for new sites - Google can take 2-4 weeks to index new pages

## ✅ Immediate Actions to Get Indexed

### 1. **Manual Indexing Request (Do This First!)**
For each important page:
1. Go to Google Search Console
2. Enter the URL in the search bar at the top
3. Click "Request Indexing"
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for processing

**Priority Pages to Request First:**

### 2. **Submit Your Sitemap**
1. In Search Console, click "Sitemaps" in left menu
2. Enter: `sitemap.xml`
3. Click "Submit"
4. Should show "Success" status

### 3. **Build Quality Backlinks**
Google indexes pages faster when other sites link to them:
- Submit to painting contractor directories
- Create social media profiles with links
- Guest post on painting industry blogs
- List in local business directories

### 4. **Internal Linking (Just Added!)**
I've added a QuickLinksSection to your homepage that links to all major pages. This helps Google understand your site structure.

## 🔍 Why Pages Aren't Indexed Yet

### Common Reasons:
1. **New Site** - Google takes time to trust new domains
2. **Low Authority** - Need more backlinks
