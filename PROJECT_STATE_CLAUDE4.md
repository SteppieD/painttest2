5. **Immediate Value:** Let users see app value before requiring configuration

## üéØ Project Context for Claude 4

**Current State:** The painting quote app now features a completely flexible product management system. Users can immediately start creating quotes without any setup requirements, add popular products with one click, and customize products per quote without affecting global settings.

**Last Working Session:** Completely overhauled the onboarding and product management experience. Removed mandatory setup flows, added popular product quick-add functionality, implemented per-quote product customization, and enhanced the overall user experience with flexible workflows.

**Key Innovation:** Users can now immediately access all app functionality while having the option to configure products when needed, either globally or per-quote. The popular products library makes setup extremely fast when users choose to configure products.

**Ready for:** Product import/export, advanced business intelligence, supplier integrations, or mobile optimization.

**Important Notes:**
- Build passes successfully with no TypeScript errors
- All core functionality maintained while adding new product features
