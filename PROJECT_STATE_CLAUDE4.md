## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Key Technologies
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 with App Router, React 18, TypeScript
- **Database:** SQLite with better-sqlite3
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **AI Integration:** Google Generative AI (not actively used in current flow)

### Core File Structure
```
app/
  create-quote/page.tsx           # Main quote creation chat interface
  api/quotes/route.ts             # Quote CRUD operations
  api/quotes/[id]/route.ts        # Individual quote operations
lib/
  professional-quote-calculator.ts # Core calculation engine
  improved-conversation-parser.ts  # Natural language processing
  database/init.ts                # SQLite schema and initialization
```

## üé® Features Implemented

### 1. Multi-Select Surface Selection ‚úÖ
- **Silent Selection:** Surface buttons toggle without AI responses
- **Visual Feedback:** Selected buttons get blue background
- **Continue Logic:** Continue button appears only after selections
- **Markdown Rendering:** Bold text renders properly (no ** symbols)

### 2. Room-by-Room Ceiling Measurements ‚úÖ
- **Smart Detection:** When ceilings selected, automatically goes to room-by-room flow
- **Natural Input:** "12 by 14, 9 foot ceilings" or "12x14x9"
- **Room Naming:** Custom room names like "Living Room: 12x14x9"
- **Room Tracking:** Individual room data with automatic calculations
- **Professional Display:** Detailed room breakdown in quotes

### 3. Interactive Room Editing System ‚úÖ **NEW**
- **Edit Buttons:** Click "‚úèÔ∏è Edit [Room Name]" buttons on any room
- **Real-Time Updates:** Quote automatically recalculates after room edits
- **Multiple Edit Points:** Available during room collection AND in final quote
- **Current Dimension Display:** Shows existing dimensions before editing
- **Natural Language Input:** Same parsing as room creation
- **Seamless Integration:** Maintains all other quote functionality

### 4. Improved Natural Language Parsing ‚úÖ **NEW**
- **"Name and Address" Patterns:** Handles "tim and its' resin drive" correctly
- **Address Keyword Detection:** Recognizes address terms without requiring numbers
- **Better Fallback Logic:** Smarter parsing when input is ambiguous
- **Enhanced Customer Info:** More robust handling of casual input styles

### 5. Quote Calculation Engine ‚úÖ
- **Industry Standards:** Professional painting formulas
- **Material Calculations:** Paint gallons, primer, coverage rates
- **Labor Calculations:** Per sqft rates for walls/ceilings, per item for doors/windows
- **Markup System:** Configurable profit margins
- **Overhead Calculations:** 10% overhead on materials + labor

### 4. Database Schema ‚úÖ
```sql
CREATE TABLE quotes (
  -- ... existing columns
  room_data TEXT,        -- JSON array of Room objects
  room_count INTEGER,    -- Quick reference for room count
  -- ... other columns
);
```

## üîÑ User Flow (Current State)

### Standard Interior Quote Flow:
1. **Login:** Access code DEMO2024
2. **Customer Info:** Name and address (improved natural language parsing)
3. **Project Type:** Interior/Exterior/Both
4. **Surface Selection:** Multi-select with blue highlighting
5. **Room Collection:** (If ceilings selected - automatic)
   - Room count selection
   - Individual room dimensions with naming
   - Edit buttons for each room ‚ú® **NEW**
6. **Wall Dimensions:** Linear footage for non-ceiling surfaces
7. **Doors/Windows:** Count items needing painting
8. **Paint Quality:** Good/Better/Best selection
9. **Markup Selection:** 10%/20%/30%/40% profit margin
10. **Quote Review:** Professional breakdown with room edit buttons ‚ú® **NEW**
11. **Save Quote:** Store to database

### Key Conversation Stages:
- `customer_info` ‚Üí `project_type` ‚Üí `surface_selection` ‚Üí `room_count` ‚Üí `room_dimensions` ‚Üí `wall_dimensions` ‚Üí `doors_windows` ‚Üí `paint_quality` ‚Üí `markup_selection` ‚Üí `quote_review`
- **Edit Stages:** `edit_room` (during wall_dimensions) ‚Üí `edit_room_quote` (during quote_review)

## üß† Data Structures

### Room Interface
```typescript
interface Room {
  id: string;
  name: string;                  // "Living Room", "Bedroom 1"
  length: number;                // Length in feet
  width: number;                 // Width in feet  
  height: number;                // Ceiling height in feet
  ceiling_area: number;          // Calculated: length √ó width
  wall_area: number;             // Calculated from perimeter and height
  number_of_doors: number;       // Doors in this room
  number_of_windows: number;     // Windows in this room
}
```

### Quote Data Structure
```typescript
interface QuoteData {
  customer_name: string;
  address: string;
  project_type: 'interior' | 'exterior' | 'both';
  dimensions: ProjectDimensions;
  selected_products: PaintLevels;
  markup_percentage: number;
