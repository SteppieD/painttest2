### **Database Enhancements Needed**
```sql
-- Add customer metrics tracking
CREATE TABLE customer_metrics (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  company_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  metric_date DATE NOT NULL,
  quotes_created INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  quotes_accepted INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  revenue_generated DECIMAL DEFAULT 0,
  login_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);

-- Add subscription management
CREATE TABLE subscription_plans (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  price_monthly DECIMAL NOT NULL,
  features TEXT -- JSON
);

-- Enhance companies table
ALTER TABLE companies ADD COLUMN health_score INTEGER DEFAULT 50;
ALTER TABLE companies ADD COLUMN subscription_status TEXT DEFAULT 'trial';
ALTER TABLE companies ADD COLUMN trial_expires_at DATETIME DEFAULT (datetime('now', '+14 days'));
```

## 🔍 **Development Strategy**

### **Business Intelligence Focus**
The admin portal is designed to transform your painting contractor app into a scalable SaaS business. Focus on:

1. **Customer Success Metrics**: Track usage, retention, and growth
2. **Revenue Intelligence**: Monitor MRR, ARR, and customer lifetime value
3. **Operational Efficiency**: Automate onboarding, support, and billing
4. **Growth Optimization**: Identify expansion opportunities and reduce churn

### **Technical Implementation Pattern**
```typescript
// 1. Create API endpoint first
/api/admin/[feature]/route.ts

// 2. Build React components
/components/admin/[feature]/

// 3. Create pages that use components
/admin/[feature]/page.tsx

// 4. Test and iterate
npm run build && npm run dev
```

## 🚨 **Important Notes**

### **Authentication & Security**
- Admin sessions expire after 24 hours
- All admin actions are logged in `admin_activity_logs`
- Role-based access control is implemented (super_admin, admin, support, marketing)
- Activity monitoring tracks IP addresses and user agents

### **Database Considerations**
- SQLite is currently used for development
- Production should consider PostgreSQL for scalability
- All admin tables use UUID primary keys for security
- Audit trails are maintained for compliance

### **Performance Optimization**
- Admin portal is separate from customer app
- Analytics queries are optimized with proper indexing
- Real-time metrics update every 30 seconds
- Export functions handle large datasets efficiently
