                <h3>The Reality Check</h3>
                <p>
                  While other industries embraced digital transformation, 83% of painting contractors still use manual processes from the 1990s. They're losing to competitors who quote faster, communicate better, and operate more efficiently.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>
            Your competition isn't just other painters anymore. It's contractors who can quote in 6 minutes while you take 3 hours. Who track every job's profitability while you guess. Who delight customers with professional systems while you scramble with spreadsheets.
          </p>

          <p>
            The gap is widening every day. But the good news? Catching up is easier than you think, and the payoff is massive.
