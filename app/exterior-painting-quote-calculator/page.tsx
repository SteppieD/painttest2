                    These are base prices for vinyl/fiber cement siding in good condition. 
                    Wood siding, stucco, or brick add 20-35%. Extensive prep work, multiple stories, 
                    and architectural details increase costs. Use our calculator for accurate, customized estimates.

                  Our calculator achieves 93% accuracy by analyzing house dimensions, surface materials, 
                  regional labor costs, and weather factors. It uses data from 250,000+ professional 
                  exterior painting projects to provide estimates typically within 5-10% of actual quotes.

              </CardHeader>
              <CardContent>
                <p>
                  Professional exterior quotes include: pressure washing, surface preparation (scraping, 
                  sanding, caulking), primer application, 2 coats of quality paint, trim and detail work, 
                  cleanup, and typically a 3-5 year warranty. Extensive repairs or wood replacement are additional.

              <CardContent>
                <p>
                  A typical 2,000 sq ft house takes 3-5 days with a professional crew of 3-4 painters. 
                  Larger homes or those requiring extensive prep can take 1-2 weeks. Weather delays 
                  should be factored in, adding 2-3 potential buffer days.

              <CardContent>
                <p>
                  The biggest cost factors are: house size and height (2-3 stories add 25-40%), 
                  surface material (wood/stucco cost more than vinyl), condition requiring prep work, 
                  number of colors, architectural complexity, and regional labor rates.

              <CardContent>
                <p>
                  Ideal conditions are temperatures between 50-85Â°F with low humidity and no rain. 
                  In most regions, this is late spring through early fall (May-September). 
                  Avoid painting in direct sunlight, extreme heat, or when rain is forecast within 24 hours.
