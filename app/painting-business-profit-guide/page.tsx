                <h3>Why Most Painting Contractors Struggle with Profit</h3>
                <p>
                  64% of painting contractors operate on margins below 20%. They're busy, but not profitable. The average contractor leaves $40,000+ on the table annually through poor pricing, cost control, and efficiency.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>
            Your painting business generates $300K in revenue but you're only keeping $45K in profit. You're working 60-hour weeks but your bank account doesn't reflect it. Meanwhile, your competitor down the street works fewer hours but drives a new truck and takes vacations.
          </p>

          <p>
            The difference isn't luck or connections. It's systems. Profitable painting contractors understand their numbers, price strategically, and operate efficiently.
