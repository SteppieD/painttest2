# Performance Optimization Summary

## ‚úÖ **COMPLETED - Performance Issues and N+1 Queries Fixed**

### **Problem Statement**
The application suffered from significant performance issues including:
- N+1 query patterns causing hundreds of unnecessary database calls
- Multiple API endpoints being called sequentially instead of in parallel

**Key Features:**
- **Eliminated N+1 Queries**: Replaced multiple individual queries with optimized JOINs
- **Query Caching**: Implemented 30-second TTL cache for frequently accessed data
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of query execution times and slow queries
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient bulk insert/update operations
- **Database Optimization**: WAL mode, connection pooling, and pragma optimizations

**Metrics Tracked:**
- Query count and average execution time
- Cache hit rates and efficiency
- Slow query identification (>100ms threshold)
- Memory usage and optimization status

## üéØ **2. Optimized API Endpoints**

## üéØ **5. Database Query Optimizations**

### **Dashboard Queries**
```sql
-- BEFORE: Multiple queries (N+1 pattern)
SELECT * FROM companies WHERE id = ?;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM quotes WHERE company_id = ?;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers WHERE company_id = ?;
-- ... many more individual queries

-- AFTER: Single optimized query
WITH company_stats AS (...),
     quote_metrics AS (...),
     customer_metrics AS (...)
SELECT [all data with JOINs and aggregations]
```

### **Customer Queries**
```sql
-- BEFORE: Query + N individual customer detail queries
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE company_id = ?;
-- Then for each customer:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM quotes WHERE customer_id = ?;
SELECT SUM(revenue) FROM quotes WHERE customer_id = ?;

-- AFTER: Single query with JOINs
SELECT 
  c.*,
  COUNT(q.id) as quote_count,
  SUM(q.revenue) as total_revenue,
  AVG(q.final_price) as avg_quote_value
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN quotes q ON c.id = q.customer_id
WHERE c.company_id = ?
GROUP BY c.id
```

### **Quote List Optimization**
```sql
-- BEFORE: Multiple queries for each quote
SELECT * FROM quotes WHERE company_id = ?;
-- Then for each quote:
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE id = ?;
SELECT * FROM companies WHERE id = ?;

-- AFTER: Single query with all JOINs
SELECT 
  q.*,
  c.company_name,
  cust.name as customer_name,
  -- Calculated breakdown fields
FROM quotes q
LEFT JOIN companies c ON q.company_id = c.id
LEFT JOIN customers cust ON q.customer_id = cust.id
WHERE q.company_id = ?
ORDER BY q.created_at DESC
```
